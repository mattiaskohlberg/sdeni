      <h1>Saint Denis</h1>
      <p>Saint Denis is a Christian martyr and patron saint of France. He was a third-century bishop of Paris who was martyred during the persecution of Christians by the Roman Emperor Decius. According to tradition, after being beheaded, Saint Denis picked up his own head and walked several miles preaching a sermon before finally dying. Saint Denis is often depicted holding his own head in Christian art and is considered a symbol of steadfast faith and courage in the face of persecution. The Basilica of Saint Denis, located in a suburb of Paris, is named after him and is considered the first example of Gothic architecture. It is also the final resting place of many French monarchs, including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.</p>
